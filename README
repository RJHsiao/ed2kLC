ed2kLC - the ed2k Link Converter is a simple GUI program for convert ed2k 
link between without tag, HTML tag and BBcode tag that we usually post it 
on the forum and web. The ed2k Link Converter also can convert ed2k link 
between with UTF-8 encode (ex: "%E4%B8%AD%20%E4%B8%AD") and without UTF-8 
encode that you can see it clearly (ex: "中 中"). You can run it on
Unix-like system and Windows.

Feture:
  1. Detect ed2k links and convert.
     That means, it will work fine even there are more then one regular
     ed2k links. If there is not any regular ed2k link in non-empty line
     and there are regular ed2k links in the other line, the program will
     remember the line number, continue to convert, and tell you the
     number(s) at last.

  2. Convert links between with html tag, BBcode tag, and without tag.
     In fact, the program will only catch the part of string that matched
     with the regex of regular ed2k link, then you can choose whitch
     outputyou want:

     a. html tag. Just a simple hyperlink markup like
        <a href="{link}">{name}</a>

     b. BBcode tag. It almost used in many message boards. Looks like:
        [url={link}]{name}[/url]

     c. No tag, just only ed2k links.

  3. Convert links between with UTF-8 encode (ex: "%E4%B8%AD%20%E4%B8%AD")
     and without UTF-8 encode that you can see it clearly (ex: "中 中").
     In most case, using the links with UTF-8 encode is recommand and it's
     the default setting in this program.

  4. Copy the converted links into the system clipboard automatically.
